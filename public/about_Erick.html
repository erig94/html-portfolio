<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in Mexico living in Japan, polyglot, teacher, and an aspiring programmer.</p>

<p>Being able to speak over 6 languages woke my curiosity to learn another type of language. This time, I wanted to start learning programming languages. I am currently learning Python and html.</p>

<p>Started Python in February 2024, and html in July of the same year, I am highly motivated to achieve 'proficiency' in these and more languages and use this knowledge for creativity.</p>
